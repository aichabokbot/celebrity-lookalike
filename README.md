# Celebrity Lookalike Finder

This project builds a face recognition feature that takes as input the picture of someone and outputs the celebrity that looks the most like them.

It is based on the [YouTube Faces with Keypoints Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/selfishgene/youtube-faces-with-facial-keypoints) from Kaggle.
